Usage: niet /usr/bin/someprogram foo bar
          - Runs someprogram with the arguments 'foo' and 'bar', restarting the program again if it
            dies, waiting for up to %ds if it's dying in less than %ds. Sends output from the program
            on its stdout and stderr to syslog using `logger`.  If sent a TERM signal, sends a TERM
            signal to the program, waits for it to finish, and then restarts it.  If sent a QUIT
            signal, sends a TERM signal to the program, waits for it to finish, and then quits.

            niet requires no privileges and should be run as the user you want to run the daemon under.
            It can be run as root, but running your daemons as root is generally discouraged.

Options: -o daemon.notice  Changes the log priority of the syslog messages logged from the program's
                           stdout to 'daemon.notice'.  Default: %s.
         -e daemon.alert   Changes the log priority of the syslog messages logged from the program's
                           stderr to 'daemon.alert'.  Default: %s.
         -t syslog_tag     Changes the syslog tag of the syslog messages logged from the program's
                           stdout & stderr to 'syslog_tag'.  Default: the program's command name.
         -k 15             Sets a timeout of 15 seconds after the program is sent a TERM signal,
                           after which it will be killed by a KILL signal.  Default: no KILL signal.
         -p /var/run/x.pid Writes the PID of this process to /var/run/x.pid.  Default: no PID file.
                           The use of PID files is discouraged: they're just another thing to go
                           wrong.  niet is designed to be controlled entirely using signals, which
                           you can use without PID files, eg. `killall niet` or `killall -QUIT niet`;
                           you can tell when niet (and therefore the supervised program) has
                           terminated because there's nothing left to kill.


Installation:

	make && sudo make install
